Link Scraper
============

What is this?
-------------------
This link scraper will:
- visit a list of URLs/pages from a Google Spreadsheet
- scrape links from the content area and right sidebar of of those pages
- follow those links and report errors

How to use this program
----------------------------------
Click on linkScraper.zip. This will take you to a page with a big gray box with a "View Raw" link in it. Right-click on that link and save it.

You will need to have a Google spreadsheet of links you want to scrape.
