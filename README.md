Link Scraper
============

What is this?
-------------------
This link scraper will:
- visit a list of URLs/pages from a Google Spreadsheet
- scrape links from the content area and right sidebar of of those pages
- follow those links and report errors

How to use this program
----------------------------------
1. Click on linkScraper.zip. This will take you to a page with a big gray box with a "View Raw" link in it. Right-click on on the "View Raw" link and save the link.

2. Navigate to wherever you saved the link. You should see a file called linkScraper.zip. Unzip it, open the folder, and double-click on linkScraper.exe.

3. PLEASE READ THE DIRECTIONS IN THE DIALOG BOX. If you have a lot of links to test, the scraper may take a few minutes to run.

4. You will need to have the URL of a Google spreadsheet of links you want to scrape.

Notes
--------------

1. The Google Spreadsheet must be available from a umich.edu account - in other words, a spreadsheet viewable by leftwich@gmail.com but not by leftwich@umich.edu WILL NOT WORK as a source of links.
